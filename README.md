# Dimple Heads
This application was created with the Michigan Golfer in mind. Specifically a Michigan Golfer because Michigan is my home state and I chose to create an application that I would actually use while out on a golf course. This was also decided after failing to find a free source of information about golf courses all over the country. To create the database used within this application, I chose a number of golf courses throughout the great state of Michigan that I could get most information needed online.

## Initial Launch
Upon the initial launch of the application, a user is prompted to log into their account. If an account is not yet created they will have to click the create account button.

## New Round
When a new round of golf is being played the username chosen by the user is automatically populated for player 1. A round of golf can include anywhere from just one player up to four total players.

## Scorecard
Unfortunately for the user, when I created the database of golf courses I was unable to find a source that had the number of strokes for par for each hole so I am depending on the user to input that data. Fortunately for the user, it is not absolutely necessary to input par for each hole. The database does know the par of the entire course which is displayed after a round is complete.

Another feature within the scorecard activity is the course information. When a user clicks on the icon in the top left corner a pop up is displayed showing the course information.

## Completed Round/Standings
After a round has been completed the players are sorted by lowest score, which is the goal of a round of golf. The rankings sort of follow the standard gold, silver, bronze trophy or medal idea. There is also a small bit of text at the bottom of this screen displaying the course par.

## Home Screen
This screen will be the first thing a logged in user will see. A freshly new user will not have data for the "statistics" found under their chosen name/username but as you can see below, once a round is finished the statistics portion of this screen is updated accordingly. The statistics button found on this page has no current functionality as this project was developed within a very small time frame.

## Creation
This application was created and designed solely by me, Matthew Vladika. This was done so in only one month and there is definitely some features I wish I had time to implement, such as the users statistics page and there were some features that I wish I had more time to develop further, such as autofilling the par for each hole on the scorecard of a selected course.
